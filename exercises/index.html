			Camp Tecumseh: Where the stars shine bright and the leaves are green. This summer camp in Brookston, Indiana has been creating lasting memories in the hearts of 4&ndash;16 year olds for over 50 years.

		<p class="entry-content">
			Camp Tecumseh is a Christian Summer Camp in Brookston, Indiana that is centered around the I&#x27;m Third Motto. The I&#x27;m Third Motto states: <q cite="http://camptecumseh.org">God is First, Others are Second, and I am Third.</q> This motto hopes to instil within campers a dedication to the <a href="#"><abbr title="Commomly Accepted Chritian Values">CACV</abbr></a>, which are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Compassion For All</li>
				<li>Compassion for Self</li>
				<li>Compassion for Nature</li>
			</ol>
			<p>And as is obvious with these values, the Camp does have a religious overtone. Campers begin each day with <em>Chapel</em> and end their day with <em>Devotions</em> where a cabin comes together to share highlights&mdash;or lowlights&mdash;of their day. Albeit the religious overtone the Camp has no intentions of creating or brainwashing soliders for any denomination, but rather circles around the idea of Red-Lettered Christianity and helping each camper find and be with God in his/her own way. The Camp's Mission is clealy visible in its counselors.</p>
